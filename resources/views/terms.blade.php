                            “Us/We/Our” refers to Chin Plumbing Services Inc.
                            “You” refers to you: the customer (the person or organisation for whom we agree to carry out work and/or supply or materials).
                            “Tradesperson/tradespeople” refers to the representative(s) appointed by Chin Plumbing to carry out work.
                            We reserve the right to refuse or decline to undertake any work. We reserve the right, at our absolute discretion, to designate the tradesperson/tradespeople who will represent us.

                            <br><b>5. Hourly Rate Work</b><br>

                            The total charge to you will consist of the cost(s) of:

                            Labour (the amount of time spent by the tradesperson carrying out work) including all reasonable time spent in obtaining non-stocked materials, charged in accordance with our current hourly rates.
                            Materials supplied by us (not exceeding the trade purchase price of materials +25% markup).
                            You will only be charged for the time spent related to your work. 
                            All other time, i.e. lunch breaks, is non-chargeable. 

                            <br><b>6. Fixed Price Work</b><br>

                            The total charge to you will be given as a firm cost (manifest errors exempted), 
                            inclusive of labour & materials, and will be within 10% over the equivalent total hourly rate cost.
                            
                            Where a written estimate has been supplied to you, 
                            the total charge outlined in the estimate should not exceed the actual time taken by more than 20%, 
                            but may be revised in the following circumstances:

                            If, after submission of the estimate, you instruct us (in writing or verbally) to carry out additional work not referred to in the estimate.
                            If, after submission of the estimate, there is an increase in the price of materials.
                            If, after submission of the estimate, it is discovered that further work needs to be carried out which were not anticipated when the estimate was prepared.
                            If, after submission of the estimate, it is discovered that there was a manifest error when the estimate was prepared.
                            We will not be under any obligation to provide an estimate to you and will only be bound by estimates given in writing to you and signed by an authorised representative. 
                            We will not be bound by any estimates given orally or in which manifest errors occur.

                            <br><b>7. Offers & Incentives</b><br>

                            On an ongoing basis, at our discretion, we promote a selection of offers and incentives,
                            these will be clearly defined including any specific terms & conditions. 
                            Offers and incentives may only be used in conjunction with each other at our discretion.

                            Collection of non-stock items is chargeable, however:

                            Time taken will be kept to a minimum and within reason.
                            If the collection time is likely to exceed 45 minutes you should be additionally informed of the circumstances.
                            Only one tradesperson is permitted to leave the job to collect required materials/parts.
                            <br><b>9. Invoices & Payment</b><br>

                            Upon your agreement for us to carry out estimated or PreBooked work, 
                            a deposit payment of 50% of the total is payable immediately. 
                            We reserve the right to request full payment in advance at our discretion.

                            Upon completion of work you will be invoiced, for which payment is due on receipt.
                            Chin Plumbing reserves the right to accrue and charge interest on any part of an
                            invoice which remains unpaid at a rate of 4% over the base rate until payment is received by us in full.

                            You accept sole liability to make payment in full,
                            unless you disclose when initially instructing us, to carry out work and/or supply
                            materials that you are acting on behalf of a third party.

                            <br><b>10. Timekeeping</b><br>

                            Where the date and/or time for work to be carried out is agreed,
                            we will use reasonable endeavour to ensure that the tradesperson attend accordingly.
                            We accept no liability in respect of the non-attendance or late-attendance on site of the tradesperson,
                            or for the late or non-delivery of materials.

                            We will not be liable for any delay, or for the consequences of any delay,
                            in performing any of our obligations if such delay is due to any cause beyond our reasonable control,
                            and we will be entitled to a reasonable extension of the time for performing such obligations.

                            <br><b>11. Cancellation</b><br>

                            If you need to cancel (or rearrange) your booking,
                            you must notify us (preferably by telephone)
                            by the end of the working day before the scheduled booking.

                            and you should request written confirmation from us, so that you are not liable to be charged.

                            or materials being supplied, you will be liable for the cost of any time and materials incurred by us,
                            together with the profit that would have been made by us, in accordance with the original instructions.

                            <br><b>12. Satisfaction</b><br>
